## Paragraph

By writing regular text you are basically writing a paragraph.

## Headings

There are 6 heading variants. The number of "#" symbols, followed by text, indicates the importance of the heading.

## Emphasis

Modifying text is so neat and easy. You can make your text bold, italic and strikethrough.

Using two asterisks **this text is bold**.
Two underscores __work as well__.
Let's make it *italic now*.
You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_.
Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely.
What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?

## Blockquote

Want to emphasise importance of the text? Say no more.

> This is a blockquote.

## Images

The best way is to simply drag & drop image from your computer directly. You can also create reference to image and assign it that way.
Here is the syntax.

## Links

Similar to images, links can also be inserted directly or by creating a reference. You can create both inline and block links.

## Code

You can cerate both inline and full block code snippets. You can also define programming language you were using in your snippet. All by using backticks.

```js
const x = "Block code snippet in JS";
console.log(x);
```

## Lists

As you can do in HTML, Markdown allows creating of both ordered and unordered lists.

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. React

## Table

Great way to display well-arranged data. Use "|" symbol to separate columns and ":" symbol to align row content.

| Left Align (default) | Center Align | Right Align |
| :------------------- | :----------: | ----------: |
| React.js             | Node.js      | MySQL       |
| Next.js              | Express      | MongoDB     |
| Vue.js               | Nest.js      | Redis       |
